  <h2>About Vehari</h2>
  <p>
    Vehari is a historic and agriculturally rich city located in the southern part of Punjab, Pakistan.
    It serves as the administrative center of Vehari District and is well-connected to other cities like Multan and Bahawalpur via road and rail.
  </p>

  <p>
    The city's name is believed to be derived from the Sanskrit word "Vehar," meaning a place of residence or settlement.
    Over the years, Vehari has evolved from a small village into a thriving city known for its economic, cultural, and educational significance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Vehari is a major hub for the cotton industry and is often referred to as the <strong>“City of Cotton.”</strong>
    Along with <strong>sugarcane, wheat</strong>  and <strong>rice</strong> are also widely cultivated, making agriculture the backbone of its economy.
    The district is supported by an extensive canal system originating from the Sutlej River, which helps irrigate its fertile land.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to its economic strengths, Vehari is home to several educational institutions such as COMSATS University Vehari Campus,
    Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) Sub-Campus, and multiple public and private schools. These institutions are shaping the future of the region's youth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The local culture is deeply rooted in Punjabi traditions, with colorful festivals, hospitality, and a strong sense of community.
    The people of Vehari are known for their warmth, simplicity, and strong work ethic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're visiting for business, education, or tourism, Vehari welcomes you with open arms and offers a unique blend of tradition, progress, and natural beauty.
