  <h1>what is Lorem ipsum</h1>

  <img src="images/loreum ipsum image.jpg" alt="Lorem Ipsum Image" />

  <p class="center">
    <em>lorem Ipsum </em>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
    <strong>loreum Ipsum </strong>has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <strong>1500s,</strong>
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

  <h1>when we use it?</h1>

  <p class="center">
    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
    content of a page looking at its layout. The point of using <em>Lorem Ipsum</em>
    is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
    'Content here, making it look like readable English.
